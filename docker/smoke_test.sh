# Smoke test for released DEEPX Docker images.
#
# No NPU hardware required: every check is an import / file-existence / plugin
# registration probe. Nothing here opens an NPU device, so this runs on a plain
# GitHub Actions runner as well as on a developer machine.
#
# Usage: docker/smoke_test.sh <image_ref> <component> [variant]
#   component : runtime | compiler | modelzoo
#   variant   : rt | rt-app | rt-stream | rt-app-stream   (runtime only; default rt-app-stream)
#
# The image must already be present locally (built with `--load`, or pulled by
# the caller). This script never pulls, so it cannot silently test an image
# other than the one the caller just built.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = all checks passed
#             1 = a check failed, or the image is not present locally
#             2 = usage error (missing/unknown arguments)
#
# All progress and results go to stdout, so `smoke_test.sh … > smoke.log` keeps a
# complete transcript including failure detail. stderr carries only usage and
# preflight errors.
