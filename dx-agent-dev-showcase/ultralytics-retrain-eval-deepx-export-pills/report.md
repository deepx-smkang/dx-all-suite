# Pharmaceutical Pill Detector — YOLO26n Domain Retrain + DeepX 4-Way Evaluation

**Task:** adapt the COCO-pretrained `yolo26n` general detector into a single-class
`pill` detector for a pharmaceutical pill identification / counting station, then
compare accuracy and speed for the base and retrained models in fp32 (GPU) and INT8
`.dxnn` (DX-M1 NPU).

> Note on FPS: the fp32 numbers are single-image inference latency on the RTX 5060 Ti
> GPU; the INT8 numbers are on-device DX-M1 NPU latency. They are **not** the same
> hardware — the GPU column is the fp32 reference, the NPU column is the **deployable
> edge** result. The meaningful edge metric is row 4 (retrained INT8 on the NPU).

## Analysis

### 1. Accuracy gain from domain retraining (rows 1 → 3, fp32)

The base `yolo26n` is COCO-trained on 80 everyday-object classes and has **never seen a
pharmaceutical pill** as a labeled class. On the medical-pills val set it scores
**mAP50-95 ≈ 0.0010** — essentially zero
(its COCO classes don't correspond to `pill`). Fine-tuning for 40
epochs rebuilds the detection head for the single `pill` class and lifts accuracy to
**mAP50-95 = 0.7583 /
mAP50 = 0.9698** — a gain of **+0.7573 mAP50-95** over the base.
This is the core result: the general detector is unusable for pill detection/counting,
and domain fine-tuning makes it viable.

### 2. INT8 quantization effect (rows 3 → 4, retrained fp32 vs DeepX INT8)

Exporting the retrained model with `format=deepx` (INT8, DX-M1) costs little accuracy:

| Metric | fp32 (GPU) | INT8 (NPU) | Δ absolute | Δ relative |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| mAP50-95 | 0.7583 | 0.7484 | -0.0099 | -1.3 % |
| mAP50 | 0.9698 | 0.9690 | -0.0008 | -0.1 % |
| mAP75 | 0.9376 | 0.9342 | -0.0034 | -0.4 % |

The INT8 `.dxnn` retains **98.7 % of the fp32 mAP50-95**. EMA calibration on
the medical-pills images keeps the quantization loss within the small range expected for
detection, so the deployable on-device model is essentially as accurate as the GPU
reference. The verify gate confirms fp32 and INT8 agree on the sample image.

### 3. Speed — the smaller domain head on the NPU

On the DX-M1 NPU the **retrained model runs at 78.2 FPS vs the base model's 55.1 FPS** (12.78 ms vs 18.14 ms/img) — **~+42%**. The retrained head has `nc=1` instead of COCO's `nc=80`, matching the KB observation that a smaller domain head makes the domain `.dxnn` faster on-device than the 80-class stock model.

## Conclusion

Domain fine-tuning turns an unusable general detector
(mAP50-95 ≈ 0.0010) into a working
pill detector (**0.7583 fp32 /
0.7484 INT8**), and the DeepX INT8
export deploys on the DX-M1 NPU while keeping **98.7 % of the fp32 accuracy**.
The deployable artifact is `yolo26n_pill_deepx_model/` (`yolo26n_pill.dxnn`). See
`sample_detect.jpg` for an annotated detection (18 pill box(es)) and `metrics.json`
for the raw measurements.
