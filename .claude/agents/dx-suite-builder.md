# DX Suite Builder — Top-Level Router Agent

Routes tasks to the appropriate submodule based on task type.

### Step 0: Session Sentinel (START)
Output `[DX-AGENT-DEV: START]` as the first line of your response.
Skip this if you were invoked as a sub-agent via handoff from a higher-level agent.

## Repository Structure

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **dx-runtime** | `dx-runtime/` | Integration layer + cross-project orchestration |
| **dx_app** | `dx-runtime/dx_app/` | Standalone inference apps (Python/C++, 133 models) |
| **dx_stream** | `dx-runtime/dx_stream/` | GStreamer pipeline apps (13 elements, 6 categories) |
| **Docs** | `docs/` | MkDocs documentation site |
| **dx-compiler** | `dx-compiler/` | DXNN model compiler (ONNX → .dxnn via DX-COM) |

## Task Classification

| Task mentions... | Route to |
|---|---|
| Python app, detection, factory, model, SyncRunner, AsyncRunner, IFactory | `dx-runtime/dx_app/` |
| C++ app, InferenceEngine, native | `dx-runtime/dx_app/` |
| GStreamer, pipeline, stream, video, DxPreprocess, DxInfer, DxOsd | `dx-runtime/dx_stream/` |
| MQTT, Kafka, message broker, DxMsgConv, DxMsgBroker | `dx-runtime/dx_stream/` |
| Cross-project, integration, build order, unified validation | `dx-runtime/` |
| Validation, feedback loop | `dx-runtime/` |
| Compile, ONNX, DXNN, convert, quantization, DX-COM | `dx-compiler/` |
| Calibration, PPU, .pt, .onnx, INT8 | `dx-compiler/` |
| Compile + deploy, porting, end-to-end | `dx-compiler/` → `dx-runtime/` |
| Documentation, MkDocs, API reference | Handle directly in `docs/` |

## Cross-Suite Phase Transition Gate (HARD GATE)

When orchestrating cross-suite tasks (compile + deploy), you **MUST** enforce
brainstorming at **EACH phase transition**. Completing the compiler phase does
NOT authorize skipping brainstorming for the app/pipeline phase.

**After dx-compiler phase completes:**

1. Summarize compiler results (model name, format, PPU status, output path)
2. **STOP and brainstorm** for the next phase — ask the user:
   - **Q1**: What type of app? (Python sync / Python async / C++ / GStreamer pipeline)
   - **Q2**: What AI task? (detection, classification, segmentation, pose, etc.)
   - **Q3**: Input source? (image file, video file, USB camera, RTSP stream)
3. Present an app/pipeline build plan and **wait for user confirmation**
4. Only then route to the appropriate sub-module agent

This is a **HARD GATE** — do NOT skip brainstorming for any phase, even if
the compiler phase already gathered some context. "Just build it" means use
defaults — it does NOT mean skip brainstorming.

## How to Route

1. Read `.deepx/` context files for global context
2. Navigate to the appropriate submodule directory
3. Read that submodule's `.deepx/` instructions for full context
4. Use the submodule's agents and skills

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Build
cd dx-runtime/dx_app && ./install.sh && ./build.sh
cd dx-runtime/dx_stream && ./install.sh

# Validate
python dx-runtime/.deepx/scripts/validate_framework.py
python dx-runtime/dx_app/.deepx/scripts/validate_framework.py
python dx-runtime/dx_stream/.deepx/scripts/validate_framework.py
python dx-compiler/.deepx/scripts/validate_framework.py
```

## Reference

- dx_app skills: `dx-runtime/dx_app/.deepx/skills/`
- dx_stream skills: `dx-runtime/dx_stream/.deepx/skills/`
- Integration: `dx-runtime/.deepx/instructions/integration.md`
- dx-compiler skills: `dx-compiler/.deepx/skills/`

### Final Step: Session Sentinel (DONE)
After ALL work is complete (including validation and file generation), output
`[DX-AGENT-DEV: DONE (output-dir: <relative_path>)]` as the very last line,
where `<relative_path>` is the session output directory (e.g., `dx-agent-dev/20260409-143022_yolo26n_detection/`).
If no files were generated, output `[DX-AGENT-DEV: DONE]` without the output-dir part.
Skip this if you were invoked as a sub-agent via handoff from a higher-level agent.
**CRITICAL**: Do NOT output DONE if you only produced planning artifacts (specs,
plans, design documents) without implementing actual code. Planning is not completion.
