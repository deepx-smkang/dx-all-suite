# DX-AllSuite Architecture Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the **DXNN (DEEPX Neural Network)** SDK architecture, its core modules, and supported environments.  

## Why DX-AllSuite?

**DX-AllSuite** integrates the complex pipeline—from model optimization to target hardware deployment—into a **Single Workflow**.  

- **Zero-Code Deployment**: Deploy logic verified on a desktop directly to edge devices without any code modifications.  
- **Resource Optimization**: Reduce the time spent on environment setup and system integration, allowing you to focus on building high-performance AI applications.  
- **End-to-End Solution**: Provides model compilation, simulation, runtime execution, and monitoring within a single package.

**[1] AI Model Compile Environment (Host Platform)**  
This environment converts and optimizes trained AI models into DEEPX NPU-proprietary binaries (`.dxnn`). It supports the **x86_64** PC environment.  

- **DX-COM (Compiler)**: The core compiler that generates `.dxnn` binaries based on ONNX models and user configuration (JSON) files. It uses proprietary algorithms to convert models into hardware-optimized instructions while minimizing accuracy loss, enabling low-latency and high-efficiency inference.  
-	**DX-TRON (Visualizer)**: A GUI tool for visualizing and analyzing the structure of `.dxnn` models. It provides color-coded graphs to intuitively show workload distribution between the NPU and CPU, helping developers understand execution flow and optimize performance.  
- **DX-ModelZoo**: A repository of pre-trained models optimized for DEEPX NPUs. By providing ONNX models, JSON configs, and pre-compiled `.dxnn` binaries, it allows developers to test and deploy models immediately without going through the compilation process.  

**[2] AI Model Runtime Environment (Target Platform)**  
This environment runs optimized `.dxnn` models on actual NPU hardware and integrates them into applications. It supports both **x86_64** and **aarch64** environments.  

-	**DX-RT (Runtime)**: The core software that interacts with firmware and drivers to run `.dxnn` models on the DEEPX NPU. It manages model loading, I/O buffers, inference execution, and real-time monitoring, offering flexible control via C/C++ and Python APIs.  
-	**DX-APP**: Sample applications built on DX-RT. It provides reference code for key vision tasks (Object Detection, Face Recognition, Image Classification, etc.), enabling developers to quickly build unique AI apps using these templates.  
-	**DX-Stream**: A GStreamer-based custom plugin that connects real-time video data to DEEPX NPU inference. It provides a modular pipeline covering pre-processing, inference, and post-processing, optimized for high-performance vision AI applications like intelligent cameras.  
- **Driver & FW**: Supports high-speed data communication via the PCIe interface and manages NPU resource scheduling and power. It ensures stability between hardware and software while maximizing the hardware's potential for a seamless inference environment.  

**Development Workflow**  
The path from a trained model to NPU acceleration follows four logical steps.  

- **Step 1.	Model Preparation**: Export a model trained in PyTorch or TensorFlow to the **ONNX** format.  
- **Step 2.	Optimization (Host)**: Compile the model using **DX-COM** with quantization and hardware optimization to generate a `.dxnn` file.  
- **Step 3.	Deployment (Target)**: Transfer the generated `.dxnn` file to the target device.  
- **Step 4.	Execution (Target)**: Run high-speed inference on the DEEPX NPU via **DX-RT**.  

## Technical Compatibility (Support Matrix)

**DX-AllSuite** provides proven compatibility with the latest operating systems and a wide range of hardware architectures, ensuring a stable bridge between your development environment and edge deployment.
