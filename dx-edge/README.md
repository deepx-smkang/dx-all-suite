# DX-Edge

**Powered by AWS · Available on AWS Marketplace**

DX-Edge is the AWS-native path for taking a trained model to a DEEPX NPU running in the field. It covers the three things that stand between a trained ONNX model and a working edge deployment — compiling the model for the NPU, provisioning the runtime on the device, and having qualified hardware to run it on — and it does each of them through AWS services you already operate.

## Three tracks

| Track | What it does | AWS delivery | Guide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DEEPX Greengrass Solution** | Compiles ONNX models to DXNN in the cloud, then installs the NPU driver, firmware, `dx_rt`, and `dx_stream` on edge devices over the air (ZTP) via AWS IoT Greengrass V2 | CloudFormation stack on AWS Marketplace | [Guide](docs/source/01_DEEPX_Greengrass_Solution.md) · [한국어](docs/source/01_DEEPX_Greengrass_Solution_kor.md) |
| **DEEPX Compiler Solution** | Compiles ONNX models into the DEEPX NPU execution format (DXNN) on AWS — either interactively on an EC2 instance or through an event-driven S3 → Lambda → Step Functions pipeline | AMI on AWS Marketplace | [Guide](docs/source/02_DEEPX_Compiler_Solution.md) · [한국어](docs/source/02_DEEPX_Compiler_Solution_kor.md) |
| **AWS HW Path — DX-AIPlayer N97** | A compact edge AI system (Intel® N97 + DEEPX DX-M1) running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, set up as an AWS IoT Greengrass core device from unboxing to first component deployment | Hardware | [Getting Started Guide](docs/source/03_AWS_HW_Path_DX-AIPlayer-N97.md) · [한국어](docs/source/03_AWS_HW_Path_DX-AIPlayer-N97_kor.md) |

## How the tracks fit together

```

```

The Greengrass Solution includes the compilation pipeline, so it is the single-stack option. The Compiler Solution is the right choice when you only need model compilation and manage device runtimes yourself.

## AWS Marketplace listings

- **[DEEPX Greengrass Solution](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-732s46qfzuh34)** (CloudFormation) — compilation pipeline + automated edge runtime deployment
- **[DX-Compiler (AMI)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ev6ed5omu4ulo)** — Amazon Machine Image with the `dxcom` compiler pre-installed

Both are free of software charge; you pay only for the AWS resources you use.

## AWS services used
