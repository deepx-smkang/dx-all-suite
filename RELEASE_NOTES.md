Here are the **DX-All-Suite v2.4.2** Release Notes.

### What's New?

This hotfix release resolves centralized runtime sanity checks, Windows build and packaging reliability (DX-RT), depth-estimation and depth-map metadata/rendering in DX-Stream, and DX-APP demo and model updates including YOLO26-Depth examples. It also adds **DX-Edge**, the AWS-native documentation set for deploying DEEPX NPUs through AWS Marketplace.

#### 📦 New: DX-Edge — Powered by AWS, available on AWS Marketplace

**DX-Edge (`dx-edge`) documents the AWS-native path from a trained ONNX model to a DEEPX NPU running in the field**, across three tracks published on AWS Marketplace.

**Highlights**
- **DEEPX Greengrass Solution** — a single AWS CloudFormation stack that provisions the cloud compilation pipeline and installs the NPU driver, firmware, `dx_rt`, and `dx_stream` on edge devices over the air (Zero-Touch Provisioning) through AWS IoT Greengrass V2. Both the classic Greengrass nucleus and nucleus lite are supported.
- **DEEPX Compiler Solution** — ONNX → `.dxnn` compilation on AWS, either interactively on an Amazon EC2 instance launched from the AMI, or fully automatically through an event-driven Amazon S3 → AWS Lambda → AWS Step Functions pipeline that starts and terminates the compiler instance per job.
- **AWS HW Path (DX-AIPlayer N97)** — a Getting Started Guide for AWS IoT Greengrass covering the Intel® N97 + DEEPX DX-M1 edge AI system, written to the AWS Device Qualification Program template.
- **Bilingual** — every document is published in English and Korean.

**Learn more** — see [`dx-edge/README.md`](dx-edge/README.md).

#### **DX AI Studio (Beta) improvements**
- **Lab Composer** — build, validate, and run inference workflows in one workspace.
- **Plugin workflow** — scaffold custom plugins and export reusable Lab packages.
- **Batch runs** — follow asynchronous inference jobs with live progress and result status.
- **Runtime diagnostics** — improved bootstrap and structured debug logging simplify setup and troubleshooting.

### Key Updates

**Performance & Efficiency**

- **DX-RT**: Improved MSVC build log by resolving Windows build warnings; Windows packaging/staging idempotency reduces unnecessary rebuilds and reconfigure failures; Ninja-forced wheel builds avoid Visual Studio generator detection issues on CI.

**Stability & Fixes**

- **DX-RUNTIME(installer)**: Centralized sanity checks into `scripts/sanity_check.sh` prevent divergent driver detection logic between `install.sh` and standalone runs.
- **DX-RT**: Staged generated headers (`gen.h`) into public include path with copy fallback when symlinks are unavailable on Windows.
- **DX-STREAM**: Self-configuring GST_PLUGIN_PATH for Windows pipeline scripts; DX-Stream and dxosd fixes improve plugin path handling and depth rendering stability on Windows.
- **DX-APP**: Moved SuperPoint point tracking out of keypoint detection post-process into the visualizer; switched depth-estimation demo from Depth-Anything-V2 to YOLO26-Depth-S; used new low-resolution source video (lowres-drone-city-road.mp4) for super-resolution demo; fixed Windows all-build parallelism by consolidating shared-file copies.

**New Features & Tools**

- **DX-RT**: `release.ver` added to Windows DXRT binaries for explicit versioning; recursive copy fallback for vendored headers (cxxopts, rapidjson) on Windows when directory symlinks are unavailable.
- **DX-STREAM**: YOLO26 depth-estimation demo pipeline and depth metadata support to DXFrameMeta and depth-map rendering to dxosd.
- **DX-APP**: YOLO26-Depth examples for all five model sizes (n/s/m/l/x, 768x768) with C++ sync/async plus Python sync/async/sync_cpp_postprocess/async_cpp_postprocess variants; registered 5 yolo26-depth models in `config/model_registry.json` and `scripts/modelzoo_manifest.json`; updated sample video archive to v3.2.2 with low-resolution source for super-resolution demos.

### What's New?

This major release focuses on **AI-Powered Development Workflow**, **Next-Generation Quantization**, and **Production-Ready Stability**. The introduction of Agent-Driven Development and advanced quantization techniques make this our most accessible and powerful release to date.

#### ✨ New: Build DEEPX NPU apps with natural language

**DEEPX Agent-Driven Development (`dx-agent-dev`) is now available in Beta.**

Describe an app or model task in plain language, and an AI coding agent drives the DEEPX knowledge base from start to finish — **brainstorm → plan → TDD → verify** — taking you from ONNX/`.pt` model compilation all the way to on-device **DX-M1 NPU** deployment.

**Highlights**
- **Natural-language workflow** — turn a plain-language prompt into a working, on-device NPU app.
- **Multi-agent support** — works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, and Codex.
- **End-to-end coverage** — model compilation (ONNX/`.pt` → `.dxnn`), inference app generation, and DX-M1 NPU deployment.
- **Ultralytics ecosystem** — purpose-built for the Ultralytics model ecosystem on DEEPX NPUs.
- **Reproducible showcases** — every bundled showcase ships with its prompt, measured results, and full build transcript.

> **Beta notice:** `dx-agent-dev` is currently in Beta. Behavior and APIs may change as the feature matures.

**Learn more** — see [Agent-Driven Development docs](docs/source/00_Agent_Driven_Development.md) and the [showcase gallery](dx-agent-dev-showcase/README.md).

#### 🖥️ New: DX AI Studio — one browser workspace for the DEEPX NPU (Beta)

**DX AI Studio is now available in Beta** — an all-in-one desktop web workspace that unifies eight DEEPX tools in a single browser, in six languages.

**Highlights**
- **Eight tools, one hub** — DX App (NPU inference on image/video/camera/RTSP with live multi-stream), DX Stream (real-time GStreamer pipelines with live WebRTC playback), DX Model Zoo (345 models with in-browser demos and one-click `.dxnn`/ONNX downloads), DX Compiler (ONNX → `.dxnn` with a config wizard, quantization tuning/diagnosis, and agentic auto-compile), DX EdgeGuide (board recommendation from real benchmarks), DX Benchmark, DX Monitor (live NPU telemetry), and DX Agent Dev.
- **Zero dependencies, self-installing** — pure Python standard library; `./launcher.sh` installs, boots every tool, and opens the browser with no manual setup.
- **Runs without hardware** — every tool degrades gracefully to sample/mock data, so the whole studio is browsable with no NPU, SDK, or models.
- **Six languages** and a built-in AI assistant (multi-provider, with a fully-offline local option).

> **Beta notice:** DX AI Studio is a Beta release (studio v0.1.0). Features and UI may change before general availability.

**Learn more** — see the DX AI Studio User Manual (`dx-ai-studio/docs/`).
