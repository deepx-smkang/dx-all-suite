"""Forbidden Test Pattern Guard — Prevent self-improvement loop from re-adding banned tests.

The self-improvement loop sometimes re-introduces hallucinated test functions
that were deliberately removed. These tests verify that banned test names and
patterns do NOT appear in the e2e test suite.

If a test here fails, a banned pattern has been re-added by the loop.
Remove the offending test function from the e2e test file.

Banned patterns and why they were removed:
- test_compilation_used_fast_calibration: tested for SingleImageCalibDataset usage,
  which is a hallucinated class that does not exist in the dx_com SDK.
- test_calibration_self_check_passed: tested for CALIBRATION_OK log marker,
  which is a hallucinated log line that does not appear in real dx_com output.
